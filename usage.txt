	How to use the system:
		First, you need to start the Group server and File server.  To do this open up 
		two terminals.  In the first terminal, enter:
				>java RunGroupServer
		
		This will run the group server on the first terminal.  If it is your first time, 
		you will be prompted to create the first user.  This user will be an admin on 
		the group server.
			Then, on the second terminal, enter:
				>java RunFileServer
		This will run the file server on the second server.  You now have both servers up and operational.
		

		To connect to the group server, open up another terminal.  In this terminal, enter:
				>java ClientApp
		First, you must enter in a username of a registered user. Second, you must enter in the IP Address 
		of the server you want to connect to.  If you are running via the Windows cmd line, the ip address is
		"localhost".  After these two steps, you will be connected to the Group Server.  Enter "HELP" to recieve instructions
		on proper syntax of valid operations supported by the Group Server.
		
		To connect to the file server, open up another terminal.  In this terminal, enter:
				>java FileClientApp
		First, you must enter in a username of a registered user. Second, you must enter in the IP Address 
		of the server you want to connect to.  If you are running via the Windows cmd line, the ip address is
		"localhost".  After these two steps, you will be connected to the File Server.  Enter "HELP" to recieve instructions
		on proper syntax of valid operations supported by the file server.
